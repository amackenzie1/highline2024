# The High Line

This repository contains the code for the numerical simulations used to generate the figures presented in the paper
[The High Line: Exact Risk and Learning Rate Curves of Stochastic
Adaptive Learning Rate Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19585)
by Elizabeth Collins-Woodfin, Inbar Seroussi, Begoña García Malaxechebarría, Andrew W. Mackenzie, Elliot Paquette, and Courtney Paquette.

## Installation
To run everything and reproduce the plots, first `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then `source run_all.sh`.
All the figures will be written to the `figures` folder.
